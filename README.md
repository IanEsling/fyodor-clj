# fyodor-clj

A Clojure library to generate random data. Relies on the Java library Fyodor under the bonnet to do the actual generation.

## Usage

Still very much a work in progress.

## License

Not sure yet, Fyodor is released under the MIT Licence so this probably should be as well, or maybe the Eclipse licence like Clojure if that's compatible.
